# Inlining a Simulink S-Block using TLC (C Code Optimization)

## Inlining Definition

To inline an S-function means to provide a TLC file for an S-Function block that will replace the C, C++, Fortran, or MATLABÂ® language version of the block that was used during simulation

## Motivation

- Reduce Memory Usage and Increase Speed
    - Using a C/C++ coded S-function has a penalty
    - limited subset of mx* API calls supported within the code generator context

- When the simulation needs to execute one of the functions for an S-function block, it calls the MEX-file for that function.

## Types of Inlining

It is helpful to define two categories of inlining:

- Fully inlined S-functions

- Wrapper inlined S-functions
