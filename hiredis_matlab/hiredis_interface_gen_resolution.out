Deleted file '/Users/deshazere/General-Atomics/fusion/projects/IRAD-1340-API/redis-simulink/hiredis_matlab/definehiredis.m'.
C++ compiler set to 'Xcode Clang++'.
Definition file definehiredis.m contains definitions for 79 constructs supported by MATLAB.
- 45 constructs are fully defined.
- 34 constructs partially defined and commented out.

To include the 34 undefined constructs in the interface, uncomment and complete the definitions in definehiredis.m.
To build the interface, call build(definehiredis).
